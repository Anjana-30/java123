(a) Object-oriented programming permits reusability of the existing
code.

ans: TRUE


(b) Languages earlier than procedural programming languages made
use of only global variables.

ANS:TRUE


(c) It is easier to write, understand and maintain programs if they use
Object-Oriented programming model as compared to Structured
programming model.

ANS:TRUE


(d) As compared to procedures, data is not given enough importance in
Procedural programming.

ANS:TRUE


(e) Structured programming model does not represent the real world
problem as well as the Object-oriented programming model.

ANS:FALSE(OOPS CAN REPRESENT REAL WORLD PROBLEMS)


(f) A class permits us to build user-defined data types.

ANS: TRUE


i) Encapsulation facilitates a single function name to be used for the
same operation performed on related derived classes.

ANS: FALSE (THIS CONCEPT IS CALLED POLYMORPHISM.)


(j) In polymorphism even though the function names are same, their
implementation may vary from class to class.

ANS:FALSE(IN POLYMORPHISM THE SAME NAME IS USED,BUT FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SAME CLASS.)


(k) Multiple objects can be created from the same class.

ANS:TRUE


(l) Object-oriented Programming paradigm stresses on dividing the
logic into smaller parts and writing procedures for each part.

ANS:TRUE


(m) Classes and objects are cornerstones of structured programming
paradigm.

ANS: TRUE


(n) Object-oriented programming paradigm gives equal importance to
data and the procedures that work on the data.

ANS:TRUE


(o) Java is a structured programming language.

ANS: FALSE(JAVA IS A OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.)
